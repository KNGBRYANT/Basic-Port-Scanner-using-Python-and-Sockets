# Why Closing Unused Ports Matters

Ports 135, 139, and 445 were found open during the scan.  
These ports are commonly used by Windows networking services.  
If not in use, they should be closed to reduce security risks.  

- Port 135 is used for Microsoft RPC (Remote Procedure Call).  
- Ports 139 and 445 are used for file sharing (SMB protocol).  
- These ports have been targets of major attacks like WannaCry.  

Leaving them open can expose systems to malware and exploits.  
Closing unused ports helps reduce your attack surface and improve system security.

# How I Closed the Ports

I disabled SMB and RPC-related services from the system settings.  
Then I used the Windows Defender Firewall to block incoming connections:  
- Opened **Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security**  
- Went to **Inbound Rules** and created new rules to block ports 135, 139, and 445  
- Applied the rule to all profiles (Domain, Private, Public)  
- Verified using a second scan that the ports were no longer open
